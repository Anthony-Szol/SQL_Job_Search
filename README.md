# Introduction
This project focused on the job market for remote data analyst roles! This
project explored top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and optimal skills to 
qualify for those top-paying roles. Additonally, this research included my 
job seach for an entry level Data Analyst role and the top skills required.
Here are questions we asked on the way:

1. What companies are hiring the most entry level remote Data Analyst?
2. What skills are important for entry level roles?
3. What are the top-paying jobs for my desired role?
4. What are the skills required for these top-paying roles?
5. What are the most in-demand skills for these roles?
6. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
 - SQL
 - PostgreSQL
 - Visual Studio Code
 - Git & GitHub

 # Findings
One thing that I found interesting was the skills required for both the entry level roles
and highest paying roles. Both job types mentioned SQL, Python, Tableau, Excel, and R in 
the same order. While the higher paying roles require a greater understand of the tools and
languages, job seekers may want to continue improving these skills. 

That being said, for those job seekers with a great understanding of the top 5 skills. Here are the top skills
in demand and highest financial reward: 
- Bitbucket
- Angular
- CSS
- FastAPI
- Keras
- Golang
- Couchbase
- Watson
- GitLab
- PySpark

These skills span various areas such as version control (Bitbucket, GitLab), web development (Angular, CSS, FastAPI), machine learning (Keras, PySpark), programming languages (Golang), and database management (Couchbase). They represent a diverse skill set highly valued in the data analyst market, with corresponding high average salaries.

 # Achievements
 This is my first GitHub repository! 

 While learning SQL with PostgreSQL and Visual Studio Code, I was able to build my confidence with skills such as, table manipulations, data functions, and subqueries/CTEs.
